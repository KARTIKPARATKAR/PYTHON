Method 1:
This method is not using any inbuilt python function like math
num=int(input("GIve the number:"))
squareroot=num**(1/2)
print("Square root of ",num," is ",squareroot)




Method 2:
This method uses the inbuilt math function by importing it as import math
import math
a=int(input("GIve number:"))
p=math.sqrt(a)
print("The square root of ",a," is",p)
